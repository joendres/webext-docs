=============
composeAction
=============

The :doc:`browserAction` and composeAction APIs first appeared in Thunderbird 64.
They are very similar to Firefox's `browserAction API`__.

__ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/browserAction

Use toolbar actions to put icons in the message composition toolbars. In addition to its icon, a toolbar action can also have a tooltip, a badge, and a popup.

Manifest file properties
========================

- [``compose_action``] (object)

  - [``browser_style``] (boolean)
  - [``default_area``] (`string <enum_default_area_2_>`_) Defines the location the composeAction will appear by default. The default location is maintoolbar.
  - [``default_icon``] (:ref:`IconPath`)
  - [``default_popup``] (string)
  - [``default_title``] (string)
  - [``theme_icons``] (array of :ref:`ThemeIcons`) Specifies icons to use for dark and light themes

.. _enum_default_area_2:

Values for default_area:

- ``maintoolbar``
- ``formattoolbar``

.. note::

  A manifest entry named ``compose_action`` is required to use ``composeAction``.
